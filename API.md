# S3K API

## Registers

Each process in S3K has access to the standard RISC-V general-purpose
registers, and a few S3K specific registers. The general-purpose registers are
as described in RISC-V and are fully controlled by the user process.

The S3K specific registers, are *virtual* registers that reside inside the
kernel. They are used to control how the process behaves and for servicing
exceptions.

- Trap program-counter (`S3K_REG_TPC`): Pointer to process's trap handling routing.
- Trap stack pointer (`S3K_REG_TSP`): Stack pointer for trap handling.
- Exception program-counter (`S3K_REG_EPC`): Program counter at time of exception
- Exception stack pointer (`S3K_REG_ESP`): Stack pointer at time of exception.
- Exception cause (`S3K_REG_ECAUSE`): Cause of exception. See RISC-V's `mcause` register.
- Exception value (`S3K_REG_EVAL`): Auxiliary information for exception handling. See RISC-V's `mtval` register.
- Preemption mask (`S3K_REG_PREEMPT`): Mask for preemption error.
  - Hides the preemption of a system call if corresponding bit is clear.
  - When a system call X (see `s3k_syscall_t`) is preempted, the system call
    will be aborted and return `S3K_ERR_PREEMPTED` if bit X is set. Otherwise
    the system call will be retried.
