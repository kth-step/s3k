S3K - Simple Secure Separation Kernel
=====================================

S3K is a capability-based separation kernel targetting embedded RISC-V systems.

More documenation will be added.

Configuration
-------------

Set your compiler toolchain in `tools.mk`. By default we have the following:
```
CC      =riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc
AR      =riscv64-unknown-elf-ar
LD      =riscv64-unknown-elf-ld
SIZE    =riscv64-unknown-elf-size
OBJDUMP =riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump
OBJCOPY =riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy
```

Build and Run
-------------

For building and running the `hello` project
```bash
# Build common libraries kernel and hello project
cd projects/hello
# Build the project
make
# Run the program using QEMU
make qemu
```

Requirements
------------

- [RISC-V GNU Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) 
  - We recommend that you clone the repository and build the toolchains as follows:
    ```
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --enable-multilib
    sudo make
    ```
    This puts `riscv64-unknown-elf-*` tools in `/opt/riscv/bin`.
  - You should then add `/opt/riscv/bin` to the `PATH` variable, e.g., `PATH=/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH`.
  - You can make the toolchain user only by setting `--prefix=$HOME/.opt/riscv` and `PATH=$HOME/.opt/riscv/bin:$PATH`.
    Then you do not need to build the toolchain with `sudo`.
- QEMU System RISC-V - Build or install QEMU with RISC-V.
  - You should have something like `qemu-system-riscv64` installed. It allows us to use our custom kernel.
  - You should not use `qemu-riscv64`, this only runs/simulates a Linux kernel.
