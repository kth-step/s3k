/**

 * @brief Capability Monitor Interface
 *
 * This file provides the interface for monitoring and managing processes
 * through capabilities. Functions include suspending and resuming
 * processes, reading and writing to process registers, and managing
 * process capabilities and PMP configurations.
 *
 * All functions require the processes to be in a suspended state for
 * operations. Error codes indicate unauthorized, invalid, or inappropriate
 * requests.
